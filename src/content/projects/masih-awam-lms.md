## Overview

**Masih Awam LMS** is a learning platform built around progression, storylines, interactive worlds, and game-like course experiences.

The product keeps the "beginner-first" goal, but the current direction is less like a conventional LMS dashboard and more like a guided learning journey: learners enter worlds, complete quests and lessons, gain progress, and move through story-driven interactions.

## Learning Experience

The current frontend already expresses the game-based direction through:

- **world-based course discovery** instead of a flat catalog-first experience
- **levels, quests, XP, checkpoints, and progress states** across the landing and dashboard
- **visual-novel learning scenes** with characters, dialogue, choices, and scene progression
- **course and lesson progress** tied to authenticated learner state
- **scroll-driven storytelling and motion** with reduced-motion support
- **large editorial typography** and lightweight UI composition without a frontend framework

The intent is to make learning feel like entering and progressing through an experience rather than simply consuming a sequence of pages.

## LMS Foundation

Under the presentation layer, the platform has a real LMS domain backed by PostgreSQL:

- courses, modules, and lessons
- enrollment
- lesson completion and calculated progress
- authenticated learner dashboards
- public course discovery and detail pages
- account, session, recovery, verification, and admin security flows

The backend is implemented in **Rust with Axum**, with PostgreSQL as the durable source of truth for users and learning state.

## Rendering and Platform Architecture

The application uses a hybrid rendering model instead of forcing the whole product into one SPA architecture:

- static/SSG delivery for build-time public content
- cacheable SSR for database-backed public pages
- `no-store` SSR for private request-specific views
- CSR for browser-owned interaction such as visual-novel state, forms, choices, and progress mutations

This keeps public content fast and indexable while preserving server authority for authentication, authorization, progress, and other security-sensitive state.

## Security and Operations

The platform includes production-minded account behavior such as Argon2id password hashing, session management, fresh-auth boundaries, email verification/recovery, admin MFA with recovery codes, security history, and scoped mutation protections.

The Rust service also emits logs, traces, and metrics through OpenTelemetry-compatible infrastructure for Loki, Tempo, Prometheus, and Grafana.

## Direction

The longer-term product direction is to make the existing character and dialogue system more adaptive, including **AI-driven characters that can guide learners through contextual dialogue and interaction**. That direction is intentionally presented as future product evolution rather than a shipped capability today.

## Stack

HTML, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, Rust, Axum, PostgreSQL, hybrid SSG/SSR/CSR delivery, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, Grafana, and Playwright.
